# Portfolio

Hi! My name is **Vika** — I’m a **data analyst** and a 4th-year student at the **HSE University (Economics program)**.
📚 I study **economics**, **machine learning**, **econometrics**, and **business analytics**.

🏃‍♀️ Outside of studying and work, I often **go running** and 🎧 **listen to podcasts or audiobooks** — it’s my way to recharge and spark new ideas.

💡 I’m passionate about combining **economics and data** — building models that help businesses make better decisions and understand economic processes.
💖 I love **clean data**, **visualizations**, and **well-structured conclusions**.
